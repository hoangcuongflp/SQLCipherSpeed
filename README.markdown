# SQLCipherSpeed

A project for testing the speed of [SQLCipher](http://github.com/sjlombardo/sqlcipher) on an iOS device, and measuring the impact of the encryption used compared to [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org).

## iOS 7 & Xcode 5

SQLCipherSpeed sets iOS 7 as the minimum deployment target. It is intended for us with Xcode 5, compatibility with earlier versions will not be maintained.
